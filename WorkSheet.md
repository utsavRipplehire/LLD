# Object-oriented programming

The goal of this worksheet to create a few classes for Scaler's entities using OOP concepts. Let us focus on the most important entity: the student. Some requirements:
1. A student should have a name, email, batch name and PSP.
2. A student should also have a status reflecting whether they are active or not. Some possible statuses are: active, paused, completed etc.
3. A student should have a method to change their status.
4. The PSP of the student should be private.
5. The PSP of a student should be within the range of 0 to 100. If it is not, then the object should not be created.

```
```

6. Replace the status string with an enum.
7. We want to generate a student's roll number. First, add an integer field ID to the student.
8.  Then add a method to generate the roll number by combining a prefix, batch name and ID. The prefix for all students is "S".

9. Create a class for a mentor. A mentor should have an id, name, email and a list of students.
```
```
---

10. Add a method to print the details of a user in the following format `name (email)`. For example, `Tantia Tope (tantia@rev.in)`
11. Creating a mentor with the students list is a bit cumbersome. Allow the mentor to be created without the students list. Set the students list to an empty list by default.
12. For a student, add a method to print the details of a student in the following format `name (email) - batchName`. For example, `Tantia Tope (tantia@rev.in) - Scaler Jhansi`

13.  You have to email all the students and mentors. What will the method signature look like?
